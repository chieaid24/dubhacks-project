    "lecture_text": "Alright class, picking up where we left off, today we're diving into a fundamental aspect of how your programs interact with the operating system: **System Calls and POSIX I/O**.\n\nAt its core, a **System Call** is how a user-level program requests a service from the operating system kernel. Think of it as a controlled entry point into the privileged kernel space to perform operations like creating files, managing memory, or accessing hardware. For example, when your C program wants to read data from a file, it can't just directly access the disk; it needs the OS to do it safely.\n\nThis is where **POSIX I/O** comes in. POSIX defines a standard set of interfaces for operating system services, particularly for input/output. Functions like `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, and `close()` are your direct line to the kernel for file operations. When you call `read()`, it's actually invoking a system call to ask the OS to fetch data from the specified file descriptor. This standardization ensures your code is portable across different Unix-like systems. We'll explore these functions and their underlying system calls in detail, understanding how they enable robust interaction with the system's resources."

    "lecture_text": "Alright everyone, let's dive into today's core material. We're moving on to **L07: System Calls and POSIX I/O**. This is where we learn how your programs interact directly with the operating system kernel to perform fundamental operations, especially input and output. Think about reading from files, writing to the screen \u2013 these aren't magic; they go through a standardized interface known as POSIX I/O, which relies on these system calls.\n\nBefore we get too deep, a few quick administrative notes. **EX6 is due today**, so please make sure you've submitted that. **EX7 will be released on Friday**, so you can take a breather for a day, but be aware it will cover material from *today's lecture and tomorrow's section*. Finally, a critical reminder: **HW1 is due at midnight tomorrow**. Remember, your official submission time is the timestamp of the git commit *tagged `hw1-final`*. If you need to use a late day token, don't worry about letting us know \u2013 they'll be automatically applied if you submit past the deadline."

    "lecture_text": "Alright, so before we dive into System Calls and POSIX I/O, let's quickly re-establish our fundamental understanding of what an Operating System *is*. At its core, the OS is that crucial layer of software that **directly interacts with the hardware**. Your applications don't talk directly to the CPU, the disk, or the network card; the OS does that. It's trusted to operate in a privileged mode, unlike your user-level programs, which are deliberately restricted for security and stability. This means the OS itself must be painstakingly ported to new hardware, but the huge benefit is that your applications become incredibly portable.\n\nBeyond that, the OS is also the ultimate **resource manager**. It's constantly allocating CPU time, scheduling tasks, and protecting different programs from interfering with each other's data. It decides precisely which program can access which files, memory locations, or even pixels on the screen, and when. Finally, and perhaps most importantly for us, the OS **abstracts away all that messy, low-level hardware complexity**. Instead of worrying about raw disk sectors or memory addresses, it provides convenient, high-level, and portable abstractions like \"files\" or \"disk blocks,\" making our lives as programmers much, much easier."
