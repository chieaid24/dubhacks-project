    "slide_text": "Alright everyone, welcome back to CSE333 for our seventh lecture. Today, we're diving into a crucial topic: System Calls and POSIX I/O. These concepts are fundamental to understanding how your programs interact with the operating system at a low level.\n\nSo, what exactly are **System Calls**? Essentially, they are the programmatic interface to the operating system's kernel. When your user-space program needs to perform a privileged operation\u2014like accessing a file, creating a new process, or managing memory\u2014it makes a system call. It's how you request services directly from the OS.\n\nBuilding on that, **POSIX I/O** refers to a standardized set of system calls specifically designed for input and output operations. POSIX provides a consistent API across different Unix-like systems for functions like `open()` to get a file descriptor, `read()` to retrieve data from it, `write()` to send data, and `close()` to release the resource. We'll explore these primitives in detail, understanding how they enable robust and portable file and device interaction for our C++ programs. Let's get started."

    "slide_text": "Alright everyone, picking up where we left off, today's lecture, L07, delves into a fundamental topic: **System Calls and POSIX I/O**. We're going to explore how your user-space programs interact with the operating system kernel to perform crucial operations like reading from and writing to files, or communicating with devices. Understanding system calls is key to grasping how software truly leverages the underlying hardware, and POSIX I/O provides a standardized interface for these interactions, allowing our code to be more portable.\n\nBefore we dive deeper, let's quickly cover some administrivia. Your **EX6 is due today**. Also, keep an eye out: **EX7 will be released on Friday**, so take a breather after EX6 \u2013 you'll need it as EX7 will draw heavily from the material we cover today and in tomorrow's section. Speaking of deadlines, **HW1 is due at midnight tomorrow**. Remember, your official submission time is determined by the timestamp of your `hw1-final` git tag. And don't worry about late day tokens; if you need them, they'll be automatically applied, no need to notify us. Let's get into it!"

    "slide_text": "Alright, picking up where we left off, today in L07 we're diving into System Calls and POSIX I/O. But before we explore how programs interact with the OS, let's solidify our understanding of what an Operating System fundamentally *is*.\n\nAn OS is the crucial software that directly interacts with the hardware itself. It's the only component trusted to speak directly to your CPU, memory, or disk controllers. User-level programs, like your web browser or a game, are *not* allowed this direct access for security and system stability; they rely on the OS to mediate. This also means the OS must be specifically *ported* to new hardware architectures, while your applications generally remain portable.\n\nBeyond just talking to hardware, the OS is the ultimate resource manager. It constantly allocates, schedules, and protects hardware resources. For instance, the OS decides which program gets to use the CPU at any given moment, which parts of memory an application can access, or whether it's allowed to write to a specific file. This prevents chaos and ensures fair access.\n\nFinally, one of the OS's most powerful roles is to abstract away messy hardware devices. Instead of dealing with the complex, low-level commands for a hard drive or network card, the OS provides high-level, convenient, and portable abstractions. For us, as programmers, this means we can simply \"open a file\" or \"send data over the network\" without needing to understand the intricate specifics of the underlying hardware \u2013 making development much simpler and our applications more portable across different machines."
