It\u2019s a way to reflect the fact \tthat even though the \u201cfirst of the month\u201d is very expensive, the \treason that it\u2019s very expensive is that it\u2019s taking on responsibility for \tall the other days.\nIf we distributed the cost equally across the days, (because all days\nshould be equally responsible), we \u201camortize\u201d the cost."
